# Shipwrecked Passengers' Topic Generator

_The place to be to add, delete, or modify topics!_

</header>


## To Modify an Existing List of Topics

_When it's time to mix it up!_

### Create a new branch in GitHub Pages

- Click the plus sign on the left column
- Name your branch anything you like, as long as there are no spaces in the name (I suggest, 'new-topics')
- Make any changes you like to the topic list(s)


### Modify the List of Topics

_in `topics`, open the `.js` file corresponding to the list you'd like to update._


- Add or edit any topic you like, ensuring there's a comma after each topic
- Delete any topic you like, or just _comment it out_ by adding `//` to the beginning of that line if you might use it later
- Save and publish your changes

## To Create a New List

_TODO_

- Other TODOs for Holls:
  - How to change the default list
  - How to change the colors/styles


## Save and Publish Changes

- Save your changes to the `.js` file
- Commit your changes within GitHub
- Open a Pull Request (PR) from your branch into the `main` branch
- Review the changes shown in the PR to double check your work
- (optional) Have someone else review the PR
- Merge your PR into the `main` branch and delete the `new-topics` branch to create a new one next time.
